There is a basic module here for you. You can just copy them to ignore a waste of time on writing the Course.java. However, I don't think that the `Course`  is the best. There are two important parameter may be `string[]` of `List<String>`, if you like, you should modify the constructor of the Course.

For a application work, the regex is not created by myself. I referred to the website. And I also use `chatgpt` to help me. This is because I think that we haven't learned the regex in the class. So it seems that we can search for Internet to find a more useful one. However, if you like to practice regex, you can learn here: [error].
